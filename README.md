# FileMaker PHP API

This is a convenience repository of the FileMaker PHP API to allow it to be installed as a project dependency using composer.

The versions are numbered to correspond with the versions of FileMaker server which they shipped with, starting from the first release version of the API which shipped with FileMaker server version 9 (and ignoring the now deprecated beta which preceded that). This code is sourced from the FM_API_for_PHP_Standalone.zip which shipped with each of those versions.

**Note**: the last tagged version is 15.0.1 as there have been no changes to the PHP API since then. This version is compatible with all subsequent releases of FileMaker server (last tested in Dec 2019 with FMS 18)
